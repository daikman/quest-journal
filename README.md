# Quest Journal
A video game quest/mission menu for managing tasks. Use it [here](https://daikman.github.io/quest-journal/)!

# Development approach
When I started this project, I had no experience using web-dev frameworks. I only knew how to write plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This is still reflected in the code! But I have refectored it a few times to make it easier to work with.

I ended up using [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) for programmatic HTML that responds to changes to the journal. I also used `js` modules and cobbled together a state management system that resembles `React.useState`.
